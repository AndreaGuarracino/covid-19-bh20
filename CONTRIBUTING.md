## How can I fix something on the repository?

- Raise mistakes, error or missing information on this repository by opening a Pull Request
  - Submit trivial fixes (for example, a typo, a broken link or an obvious error)
  - Start work on a contribution that was already asked for, or that you’ve already discussed, in a mailing list
  - A pull request doesn’t have to represent finished work. It’s usually better to open a pull request early on, so others can watch or give feedback on your progress. Just mark it as a “WIP” (Work in Progress) in the subject line. You can always add more commits later.
