# How to contribute?

First of all, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

Your contributions are important to make this project and event successful. 
You can report mistakes and errors, propose a project, offer dataset and resources or create more content. 

Whatever is your background, there is a way to contribute on this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/virtual-biohackathons/covid-19-bh20), 
on our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!forum/virtual-biohackathon)
, other [related projects listed on our wiki page](https://github.com/virtual-biohackathons/covid-19-bh20/wiki) or via [slack conversations](https://virtualbiohac-xt62674.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-cuur40oj-wdrVz50NocwVrH7vgKTdPg).

You can raise any issue relevant to this project/event publicly in the mailing list (google group), we will address and/or assess your change proposal as promptly as we
can to make your participation easier.

We have a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/virtual-biohackathons/covid-19-bh20/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that applies to all the activities and projects involved in this event.
For any organisation related queries or concern, you can directly reach out to the organisers Leyla Garcia (email: ljgarciaco@gmail.com), Pjotr Prins (email: pjotr.public708@thebird.nl) 
and  Tazro Ohta (email: t.ohta@dbcls.rois.ac.jp). 

- With such a large group of participants, we are encouraging a bottom-up approach, where groups are formed around projects/topics and work (kind of) independently from others. 
- If you need any information from another group/topic, you can always reach people via email or slack (please note that as the hacking starts, Slack might become more interactive, you can also directly ping people there, be patient please and re-ping if needed or look for an alternative contact). 
- Every group/topic will have leader/coordinator/facilitator, please check the wiki to get more information (as we get close to the hacking week, we expect the wiki to change quickly and people to add more group/topic details there). 
- We also expect group/topic leaders/coordinators/facilitators to provide a quick (daily if possible) summary via the wiki so everybody can get an idea on it.

## How can I participate at this BioHackathon community during and after the event?

Join the [Google group mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/virtual-biohackathon) and the [virtualbiohackathoncovid19 slack](https://join.slack.com/t/virtualbiohac-xt62674/shared_invite/zt-cuur40oj-wdrVz50NocwVrH7vgKTdPg) and join the conversation! No approval needed. 

Please have a look at the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/virtual-biohackathons/covid-19-bh20/wiki) to see the existing projects. 
This will help you identify possible ways to contribute to. 
Contact, via the mailing list or slack, the community working on that project and let them know of your interest and how you would like to participate. Conversation and collaboration will start from it.

## How can I fix something on the repository?

- Raise mistakes, error or missing information on this repository by opening a Pull Request
  - Submit trivial fixes (for example, a typo, a broken link or an obvious error)
  - Start work on a contribution that was already asked for, or that you’ve already discussed, in a mailing list
  - A pull request doesn’t have to represent finished work. It’s usually better to open a pull request early on, so others can watch or give feedback on your progress. Just mark it as a “WIP” (Work in Progress) in the subject line. You can always add more commits later.
  - [Read details for open a Pull request](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#opening-a-pull-request)

## How can I join the mailing list and participate in an ongoing conversation?

The mailing list works via a Google group, so by [joining the group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/virtual-biohackathon) you will get new messages and will be allowed to post.

We also have a [slack]((https://virtualbiohac-xt62674.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-cuur40oj-wdrVz50NocwVrH7vgKTdPg)) where channels (commonly corresponding to groups/topics/projects) are created and people can join and contribute to the discussion.

## How can join a project during the hackthon?
- When you’ve found a project you’d like to contribute to, 
do a quick scan to make sure that the project is suitable for accepting contributions. 
The earlier you join a group the better. Commonly, groups/topics are created on slack, so please have a look there to see if the group/topic you are interested in is already there. If not, go to general or COVID-19 and raise a question on how to join that group/topic/project. Someone will point you in the right direction. 

## How can I offer dataset and other compute resources?

People are pointing to data or offering compute resources via email. A dedicated wiki entry will include more details on the known/available data and compute resources.
