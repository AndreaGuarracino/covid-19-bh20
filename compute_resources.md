# Compute resources

[ELIXIR Europe](https://elixir-europe.org/) and [Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/) have kindly agreed to contribute with computing resources. If you can do so as well, please add your resources and your information here.

## European Galaxy server (https://usegalaxy.eu)

The European Galaxy server is offering all its compute resource for all researchers. You have access to more than 2400 tools from different scientific domains (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, cheminformatics ...), more than 3,000 CPU cores, 50TB of memory and GPUs. The majority of resources are contributed by the de.NBI cloud. If more resources are needed we can shortly access the [pulsar-network](https://pulsar-network.readthedocs.io) and distribute jobs across Europe.

Galaxy can be accessed and controlled via a rich API. For example via Python using a library called [bioblend](https://bioblend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

With https://live.usegalaxy.eu the Galaxy project is also offering Juypter Notebooks or RStudio instances for everyone that needs external compute resources. Those environments can access the storage resources from Galaxy and therefor permanent storage that can easily linked to Notebooks.

If you have any questions or problems, please contact `galaxy@informatik.uni-freiburg.de`.
